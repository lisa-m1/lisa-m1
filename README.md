## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Lisa


Iâ€™m a software engineer who enjoys solving problems, puzzles and crosswords. Iâ€™m the co-creator of QMantis, an open source observability tool :mag_right: for GraphQL APIs, built with Node.js, TimeScaleDB and OpenTelemetry. Read our [technical case study here](https://qmantis.co). 
- I love books, bikes, travelling and walking without purpose.
- I really like learning new languages. I speak English, French, Portuguese and Spanish.
